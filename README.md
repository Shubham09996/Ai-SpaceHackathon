# AstroVision ‚ú®

An AI-powered safety detection system for space missions, built during the BuildWithIndia 2.0 Hackathon.


---

## üî† Problem Statement

Astronauts rely on the availability of critical tools like fire extinguishers, oxygen tanks, and toolboxes to ensure operational safety. Any misplacement or unavailability can lead to life-threatening consequences.

---

## ü§ñ Our Solution

AstroVision is an object detection system trained using a synthetic dataset from Falcon (Duality AI). It identifies essential equipment in space station environments in real-time using a custom YOLOv8 model.

---

## ü™Ä Features

- Detects fire extinguisher, toolbox, oxygen tank
- Handles occlusion, lighting variations
- Friendly dashboard UI
- Alert system with voice + text
- Companion App Simulation
- Falcon retraining integration (conceptual)

---

## üéì Technologies Used

- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- OpenCV
- Python
- Figma (UI design)
- Streamlit (for frontend simulation)
- Falcon by Duality AI (for dataset)
